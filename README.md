## Overview

### Description

Cloud Based To-Do List where users can access their List from anywhere at any time. Our list will be able to be shared amongst collaborators so a team of people can work on the same list. The app will be able to produce personalized list to fit daily needs and change the status of each individual list item at any given point with real time update to all other collaborators on that list.
