## Overview

### Description

Cloud Based To-Do List where users can access their List from anywhere at any time. Our list will be able to be shared amongst collaborators so a team of people can work on the same list. The app will be able to produce personalized list to fit daily needs and change the status of each individual list item at any given point with real time update to all other collaborators on that list.

  - It's difficult to keep track of everything that needs to get done in a day. With the majority of people having busy schedules, I can see why it would be easy to forget something at the supermarket or maybe that surprise report your manager told you to have done by the end of the week. This app is suited so that you can keep track of the things that need to get done with out the stress of remembering.
